POSIX/RT/MQ version 0.01
========================

DESCRIPTION

POSIX::RT::MQ module provides perl interface for POSIX message queues API,
part of POSIX RealTime Extension, namely:

  mq_open()
  mq_close()
  mq_send()
  mq_receive()
  mq_getattr()
  mq_setattr()
  mq_unlink()
  
  mq_notify()  -- not yet supported by POSIX::RT::MQ


PORTABILITY

Many operating systems still lack POSIX message queues support,
so regret there are chances you'll be not able to use this module
(and POSIX message queues at all) with your favorite OS :-(

Solaris: Has POSIX message queues support since 2.6 or even earlier,
         This module should work.
         
Digital UNIX (or whatever it is called today):
         Is known to support POSIX message queues.
         I don't have any such box handy - if somebody does please
         help with module's porting !      

AIX:     POSIX mq not supported (at least in 4.3.3 and AFAIK in 5 also).
         You are likely to be able to compile this module
         but any calls will fail with "Function not implemented"
         error.

Other systems I have access to (Linux, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare)
don't support POSIX Message Queues.

   

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
